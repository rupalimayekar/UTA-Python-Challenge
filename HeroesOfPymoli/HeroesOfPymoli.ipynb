    "Below is the Analysis for a company's most recent fantasy game, Heroes of Pymoli. This Analysis is done using Python's Data Analytics library - Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, we generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observed Trend 1\n",
    "There are a lot more Male players than Female and Other/Non Disclosed Gender players. The male population of players is 81% which is significantly higher than the non-male population. This shows that boys/men purchase/play more video games\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observed Trend 2\n",
    "There are also significantly more players in the 18-26 yrs Age group. Players in the 14-18yrs age group are the next higest in numbers but that's half of the the 18-26years. This shows that the younger generation comprises of the maximum player population\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observed Trend 3\n",
    "The most popular games have additional items that are lower in price. Perhaps they are more popular because the add-ons are more affordable, and the players get a lot more to play for that price. However the most profitable games are the ones that have the add-ons that are higher in price. These bring in more revenue to the company than the more popular items.\n"
